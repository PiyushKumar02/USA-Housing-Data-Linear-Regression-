# USA-Housing-Data-Linear-Regression-
-- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on USA Housing Dataset having 5000 data points and 5 predictor variables
-- Fitted a Multiple Regression Model by backward elimination and analysed the model to diagnose problems such as Multicollinearity, Heteroscedasticity, Autocorrelation and non-normality of stochastic error term
-- Achieved an adjusted R2 value of 0.89 and the model proved to be a good fit when applied on housing - test dataset
